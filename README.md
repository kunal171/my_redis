# MY REDIS

Mini-Redis is designed with the primary goal of learning Tokio, and is therefore very well commented, but this also means that Mini-Redis is missing some features you would want in a real Redis library. You can find production-ready Redis libraries on crates.io.

We will use Mini-Redis directly in the tutorial. This allows us to use parts of Mini-Redis in the tutorial before we implement them later in the tutorial.
